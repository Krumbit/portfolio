# [Portfolio](https://krumb.it/)

### Welcome to my portfolio! 👋

Here, you can find some of my projects, skills, and methods to contact me.

This website was designed by me using **Figma** and uses **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS** to bring it to life.

## Installation 🛠️
If you wish to locally host a version of this portfolio (e.g for contributing)
### Requirements
* `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) | [macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
* `node` [Version 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en) or later installed
* `bun` ([macOS | Linux | Windows](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)) installed

> Note: Although the Bun CLI and package manager are the ones used, Next.js requires you to have Node installed on your system - that is why both it and Bun appear in system requirements.
### Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Krumbit/portfolio.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
bun install
```
3. Start dev server
```sh
bun dev
```
